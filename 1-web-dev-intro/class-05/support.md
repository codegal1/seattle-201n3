###Today's New Work: Extend and Refine
You'll be doing the following things to each other's games. After each bit of work is completed, be sure to do an add-commit-push cycle to place the code on GitHub and preserve a versioned history of your work. As with yesterday, we're done with 'alert' windows: all feedback to the user for the new questions you'll be adding should appear in the browser window, so you'll need to add new `<p>s` with `id` attributes and also `document.getElementById`'s as well.

###Add some CSS styling:
This is wide open. Use your imagination and have fun with it! You're going to need to link to a CSS file to do this, right? **a-c-p**

###Update the README file:
In the README file, add in the names of the driver and navigator and indicate that the code was worked on together. This is basic record-keeping so that you can keep up with how the code has been edited in a user-friendly format.  **a-c-p**

###Code style:
As always, strive for readable and maintainable code. Proofread. Fix any issues with indenting and other code style, such as improving variable names and ensuring that line terminations are done properly.  **a-c-p**

###Link to your partners' games:
Now add a `<ul>` to the bottom of your index.html page, and after it, include a `<li>` that contains a link to games of your parters from both Thursday and Friday. Add some styles to your list and make it look like you want!  **a-c-p**
