# Assignment for Class
Today in lab you will be doing some work in a pair, and some work individually. In the paired work, you will be adding an input form to your partner's sales data page. In the individual work, you will be working with your own sales data page to wire up the form and use it to update your table data.

We will also be replacing the lists of data for each store, and implementing a table of data instead!

**Note:** For the pair programming piece, please refer back to our previous assignment's (weeks 1-2) pair programming work for more details on how to get your partner's code set up on your machine.

## User Stories (MVP)
 - (Pair programming) As a developer, I want to implement and form on the website, so Pat has the ability to enter new stores without a developer to help him
 - (Individual) As a developer, I want to implement event management on my page, so that my form will listen and react to click events
 - As a developer, I want to present the store data in a table format on the webpage, so each store's data is easier to represent and understand

## Technical Requirements
 - Form properly implemented in the html
 - Events have been wired up and are rendering new store data to the page
 - Table has been implemented and lists are no longer used to represent store data

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a user, I want to be able to update data that is already available on the page, so that I do not have to have the developer manually remove and rewrite data.
